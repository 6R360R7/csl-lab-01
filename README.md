## Engagement:
The Internet. It creeps into everyone’s life for one reason or another.
Computers and technology. This is what the Internet is. 
Media and data. This is what ‘information’ is.

## Exploration:
To begin I’ll go through the process of making a p5.js account where we will be creating and saving out projects for this series of labs.

Second, we’ll explore at a high-level some of the elements that make the internet work. In particular, examples of front-end web technologies i.e. Javascript, html, css.

We’ll go over how these three technologies fit together to form what we know as’ online content’. I’ll give some examples of the code in the p5js editor, give some live demonstrations of the functionality of the 3 elements, and then instigate a discussion regarding the what was presented

## Explanation:
I’ll ask each participant about their understanding regarding computer code and its  uses.

## Elaboration/Extension:
Describe how students will develop a more sophisticated understanding of the concept.
What vocabulary will be introduced and how will it connect to students’ observations?
How is this knowledge applied in our daily lives?

## Evaluation:
How will students demonstrate that they have achieved the lesson objective?
This should be embedded throughout the lesson as well as at the end of the lesson.
