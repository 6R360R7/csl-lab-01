Engagement:
[Describe how the mentor will capture students’ interest.
What kind of questions should the students ask themselves after the engagement?]

The Internet. It creeps into everyone’s life for one reason or another.
Computers and technology. This is what the Internet is. 
Media and data. This is what ‘information’ is..  
Exploration:
[Present an example of the activity using a common approach. 
Describe what hands-on/minds-on activities students will be doing.
List “big idea” conceptual questions the teacher will use to encourage and/or focus students’ exploration and problem solving.]

To begin I’ll go through the process of making a p5.js account where we will be creating and saving out projects for this series of labs.

Second, we’ll explore at a high-level some of the elements that make the internet work. In particular, examples of front-end web technologies i.e. Javascript, html, css.

We’ll go over how these three technologies fit together to form what we know as’ online content’. I’ll give some examples of the code in the p5js editor, give some live demonstrations of the functionality of the 3 elements, and then instigate a discussion regarding the what was presented

Explanation:
[Student explanations should precede introduction of terms or explanations by the teacher. What questions or techniques will the teacher use to help students connect their exploration to the concept under examination?
 
List higher order thinking questions which teachers will use to solicit student explanations and help them to justify their explanations.]

I’ll ask each participant about their understanding regarding computer code and its  uses. 
Elaboration/Extension:
[Describe how students will develop a more sophisticated understanding of the concept.
What vocabulary will be introduced and how will it connect to students’ observations?
How is this knowledge applied in our daily lives?]
Evaluation:
How will students demonstrate that they have achieved the lesson objective?
This should be embedded throughout the lesson as well as at the end of the lesson.
