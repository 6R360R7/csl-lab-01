Introduction to Code

## Type:
* Virtual/Zoom
* lab exercise

## Topic:
* Create and explore p5.js’ cloud IDE

## Duration:
* ~45 minutes

## Learning Objectives:

* What are Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
* Create p5.js and explore the p5.js cloud IDE
* What p5.js can be used for
* Using p5js to learn coding

## Vocabulary:
* Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
* Web Standards Tech (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
* Code Libraries
* UI/UX

## Materials:
* Email address
* Internet Access
* Computer or Laptop
* Web Browser preferably Chrome

## Engagement:

Introduce learners to what web technologies are, and how we interact with them every day of our lives, sometimes without even knowing it. Inspire the learner to pay attention to the various interfaces they use in everyday life. Invite them to explore various coding languages and uses on their own and which tech interests them the most.

## Exploration:
Go through the process of making a p5.js account. Demonstrate some of the features in the p5.js cloud IDE and how they are used.

Explore at a high-level elements that make the internet work. In particular, examples of front-end web technologies (Javascript, html, css).

We’ll go over how the three technologies fit together. Give some examples of the code in the p5js editor, present some live demonstrations of web standards technologies. Instigate a discussion regarding the what was presented

## Explanation:
Ask each participant about their understanding regarding what I presented and invite them to explain what they think.

* What can this technology be used for?
* What good is it to learn about these technologies?
* Do these technologies inspire curiosity?
* What things do you think use code?

## Elaboration/Extension:
Learners will leave with enough knowledge to explore web technologies on their own. The examples presented will inspire their curiosity to explore web standard technologies such as Javascript, HTML, CSS. Learners will gain access to a cloud IDE wich grants them easy access to explore and learn.

## Evaluation:
I’ll ask the learners to complete an exercise that demonstrates how to write, run and troubleshoot some very basic javascript in the p5.js cloud IDE.
